# Edit this to reflect precise location of the bpq directory
cd /home/pi/node

# Any stuff that needs to start before linbpq goes here. e.g. any rfcomm attachments for 
# bluetooth TNCs etc.
#
# ---
#
# If using systemd start scripts from the doc directory, please make a symbolic link 
# from your callsign in the bpq root directory to the existing linbpq symbolic link. 
#
# The reason for the chaining of symbolic links is to assist the binary updates that are kept
# inside the bpqbin directory.
#
# In the bpq root directory (where bpq32.cfg resides):
# 
#
# ln -s linbpq yourcallsign
#
# If not using systemd, you can leave this as-is. The callsign is used to start the binary
# process as your callsign so that on a multiple-node installation it is able to differentiate
# between the different processes.
#
# Default: ./linbpq 
#
# else change to ./yourcallsign
#
./linbpq
